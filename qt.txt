Qt wiht C++

Qt is built on top of C++ and Qt Core is using C++ TO manipulate Qt and buil an actual program at all.

What is Qt?
Well, it's libraries written in C++ is kind of the standard generic answer.
However, it's a little bit demeaning because cute has grown way beyond what I would even consider a
framework and is pretty much an entire ecosystem for developers.
Pretty much C++ can do anything and Cute is written in C++, so cute can do anything and it runs almost anywhere.
They mean that.
I mean anywhere.
So cute covers everything from basic applications all the way up to no joke, high performance, multithreaded
TCP servers with a 3D headset touch screen display. Yes, you can actually do that in cute.
Believe me, I've done it. It's actually insanely cool.
This technology takes really challenging problems and makes them very straightforward and very simple.
Now, the really cool part about Q is the same code base that runs on a desktop can run on a dashboard,
a mobile device and embedded system pretty much anywhere C++ runs.
The technology is just insane once you actually wrap your head around it.

what can you make with cute?
Well, basically anything and I hate giving that answer because they kind of roll their eyes and goes,
well, yeah, anything I mean, it anything you can build in C++, you can build with cute.
So console applications, mobile applications, embedded desktop, pretty much anything.
So for example, the I.T. we're going to use cute creator was created with cute.
Chances are a lot of the popular applications you use, even video games are created with cute.
If you have a fancy TV or a like a refrigerator with a touch screen display, there's probably cute
running in that thing. It can do literally anything.
It's just crazy.
